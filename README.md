Copyright (c) 2018 by Gadi Cohen.  Released under various license for

More info coming soon, see the `dictionary` and `keys` directories.

The main goal of this project is to provide JSON files of Enochian material
accumulated from a variety of sources, that may be used for other projects.

A progressive-web-app that makes use of the above is currently in development.

Please star this project and open an issue to say hi if you're using the
material.  I'm currently operating under the assumption that I'm the only
one using this.
